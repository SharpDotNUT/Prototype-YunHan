Heyu Tea House has been a popular leisure spot for the people of Liyue.
Its business thrives on two things, one of them being its boss Fan Er’ye’s business acumen in inviting a top-notch Tea Master who tells the best stories of all.
Besides that, there is also the performance of the acclaimed troupe, Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Its director and soul — a famed opera singer named Yun Jin — takes the stage at the tea house from time to time.
While one can always get delicious delicacies or good storytelling as long as one knows where to look, Yun Jin’s performance does not just await one there.
As a result, you can always find fans of Yun Jin trying their luck at Heyu Tea House. While waiting for Yun Jin’s performance, they discuss her past performances and how they feel about them.
As such, more people frequent the tea house, with nine out of ten of them being Yun Jin’s fans.
Fan Er’ye couldn’t be more satisfied with this state of affairs.
